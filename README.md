This tool splits an image in two and joins its original outer vertical edges together.

This tool is especially valuable when creating maps centred on the Indo-Pacific region, or Australia and the Pacific. It's particularly helpful if you're using mapping software like QGIS, which doesn't support seamless, repeating world maps.
